## Address book in PureScript

Solution to exercises in chapter 8 of Purescript by Example. The solution is based on starter code from https://github.com/paf31/purescript-book, but has been converted to purescript-react v6.1.0 and purescript v0.12.0 since, as of this writing, the starter code uses deprecated APIs for react and browser effects.

## Install & Build

```
npm install
pulp browserify --to dist/Main.js
```

## Run

open dist/index.html
